***Mytube*** is a decentralized video distribution platform that aims to offer content creators greater freedom, ownership, and control over their media. Unlike traditional platforms like YouTube, which are centralized and impose strict content regulations, Mytube leverages Web3 principles to return authority to the users.  
This project is part of the broader ***JANCTION Web3 ecosystem***, where Mytube acts as the primary media platform for decentralized content sharing. It is particularly aligned with creators participating in the JANCTION STORIES initiative.  

> ***Note:*** The underlying IPFS-based decentralized content distribution technology used by Mytube is documented separately in our IPFS Node Repository.

*   ***Decentralized Ownership:*** Creators retain full rights to their content. Files are stored securely and redundantly via IPFS.
*   ***DAO-Driven Governance:*** Managed by community contributors rather than a corporation.
*   ***Token Incentives:*** Viewers and creators earn JANCTION POINTS (JCP) through engagement.
*   ***Freedom of Expression:*** No censorship of content based on centralized policies.
*   ***Optimized Storage:*** Content is distributed and cached efficiently, significantly reducing hosting costs.
